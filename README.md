# personal-library
(This readme will be better formatted later)

This is a personal project. Over the past few months, I've been discovering new technologies...actually, I've heard about them before, but have never use them properly. In this project, I want to gather my knowledge and just build something in my free time. Here, I'll place not only the code, but also a few other things that will help me. That will make sense later

## General Idea

As the title suggests, I want to build a personal library. At my house, we have a lot of books, so it's easy not to know if we have a specific book or no. My idea is to build an application just for catalogue those books. I choose that idea because I wanted something that I could easily imagine all the 'architecture' of the system. It had to be something that I could easily remember, and that fits with my current level of coding. Also, I can practice my english by writing this README and the message for the commits :) 

## Used technologies

I'll describe each one of them as soon as they get mentioned here. (e.g. "For achieve this, I'll use [some tech]"). This tech will be added to a list in this section.

### Server: Old PC STI, Motherboard model STI-005492, CPU Intel® Core™ 2 Duo E6300, 2GB RAM, SSD KINGSTON SA400S3 - 120GB.

First things first, I want to start to describe the hardware used in this project. I got and old PC that was just collecting dust, So I decided to use it this way. This computer has been through a lot since my father firstly bought it till I really learn how to use it in the best way (at least, the best for me). I'm particularly proud of myself for being capable of turn a computer with these specs into a personal server. It ain't much, but it's honest work ;) (Note: I just checked, and right now, I pretty sure that this PC is in the highest usage of memory of all time (since I started using as server: 561MB / 2GB). That's pretty cool)
 
### Main laptop: Samsung Essentials E20, CPU Intel® Celeron® 4205U, 8GB RAM, SSD KINGSTON SA400S3 - 480GB.

My main laptop, well, is pretty basic. My father also bought it...back at the time, I didn't had the knowledge I have today, otherwise, I'd definetely help him to get a laptop at least with a better CPU hahaha. Anyway...Just as described in the server section, I've learned how to use computers in the way that better suits my needs, so I know that it's possible to develop this project using this hardware. And what allowed me to use these computers as I described here was the Operating System, that I'll describe in the next section!
