# personal-library
(This readme will be better formatted later)

This is a personal project. Over the past few months, I've been discovering new technologies...actually, I've heard about them before, but have never use them properly. In this project, I want to gather my knowledge and just build something in my free time. Here, I'll place not only the code, but also a few other things that will help me. That will make sense later

## General Idea

As the title suggests, I want to build a personal library. At my house, we have a lot of books, so it's easy not to know if we have a specific book or no. My idea is to build an application just for catalogue those books. I choose that idea because I wanted something that I could easily imagine all the 'architecture' of the system. It had to be something that I could easily remember, and that fits with my current level of coding. Also, I can practice my english by writing this README and the message for the commits :)
